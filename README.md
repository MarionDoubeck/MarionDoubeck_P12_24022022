# 1. Prerequisites : Get the standard package manager for Node.js : npm
Download NodeJs on : https://nodejs.org/ 
Install it

*****************************************************************************************************

# 2. Launching Backend :
Get backend on : https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/P9-front-end-dashboard
Open it in terminal
Run 'npm i'
Then run 'npm run dev' on one port (could be localhost:3000)

This project includes four endpoints that you will be able to use: 
- `http://localhost:3000/user/${userId}` - retrieves information from a user. This first endpoint includes the user id, user information (first name, last name and age), the current day's score (todayScore) and key data (calorie, macronutrient, etc.).
- `http://localhost:3000/user/${userId}/activity` - retrieves a user's activity day by day with kilograms and calories.
- `http://localhost:3000/user/${userId}/average-sessions` - retrieves the average sessions of a user per day. The week starts on Monday.
- `http://localhost:3000/user/${userId}/performance` - retrieves a user's performance (energy, endurance, etc.).

**Warning, currently only two users have been mocked. They have userId 12 and 18 respectively.**

Examples of queries
- `http://localhost:3000/user/12/performance` - Retrieves the performance of the user with id 12
- `http://localhost:3000/user/18` - Retrieves user 18's main information.


# 3. Launching Frontend :
- Get frontend on : https://github.com/MarionDoubeck/MarionDoubeck_P12_24022022
- Open it in terminal
- Run 'npm i'
- Then run 'npm start' on another port (could be localhost:3001)

Endpoints : - `http://localhost:3000/${userId}`
**Warning, currently only two users have been mocked. They have userId 12 and 18 respectively.**
Examples of queries :
- `http://localhost:3000/12` - Retrieves user 12's main information.
- `http://localhost:3000/18` - Retrieves user 18's main information.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
